This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version 13 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This project has been developed as part of a coding assignment, emphasizing the practical implementation of advanced web features using TypeScript and the latest web development techniques.


- **Infinite Scroll**: Users can enjoy a seamless browsing experience with an infinite scroll enabling uninterrupted navigation through content.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Users can effortlessly switch between dark and light modes for comfortable readability. The mode preference is managed globally with Redux to maintain state across the application.
- **TypeScript**: Leverages TypeScript to enhance code quality and maintainability.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Uses Next.js's SSG for faster page loads and improved SEO.

## Getting Started

Before running the development server, you must install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
#or
pnpm install
#or
bun install

After the installation is complete, you can start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
